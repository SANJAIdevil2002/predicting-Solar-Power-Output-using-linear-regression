This project focuses on analyzing solar power generation data to understand the impact of various environmental and weather factors, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and radiation, on energy output. The dataset contains 4,213 entries across 21 features, including generated solar power as the target variable. Key tasks include data exploration, statistical analysis, and visualizations, such as histograms and distributions, to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. The project is designed to support solar energy optimization and forecasting, with future plans to integrate machine learning models for predictive insights and extend the analysis to time-series trends.
